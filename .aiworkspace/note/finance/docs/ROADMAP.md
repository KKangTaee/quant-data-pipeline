# Finance Roadmap

Status: Active
Last Verified: 2026-06-08

## Current State After Master Merge

현재 active phase는 없다.

2026-06-07 master 병합 후 제품은 다음 네 흐름이 함께 연결된 상태다.

```text
Workspace > Ingestion
  -> Workspace > Overview market context
  -> Backtest > Backtest Analysis
  -> Backtest > Practical Validation
  -> Backtest > Final Review
  -> Operations > Operations Console
  -> Operations > Portfolio Monitoring
```

현재 5차~10차 code structure / refactor baseline round는 closeout됐다.

- 5차: UI / service / runtime / jobs / finance layer boundary and refactor baseline audit.
- 6차: Overview / Ingestion collection-read action boundary cleanup.
- 7차 / 7B: Ingestion Console physical split and read-only diagnostic facade extraction.
- 8차: Backtest runtime Risk-On Momentum, real-money / readiness, strict quality / value family split.
- 9차: Backtest Compare Portfolio Mix Builder visual component extraction.
- 10차: final structure audit, residual split decision, and handoff closeout.

- Latest completed task: `.aiworkspace/note/finance/tasks/active/robustness-experiment-registry-20260608/`
- 목적: 기존 Robustness Lab / Validation Efficacy / Temporal Validation / Backtest Realism evidence를 `robustness_run_set_id`가 있는 compact run-set read model로 묶어 Practical Validation과 Final Review가 같은 실험 묶음을 인용할 수 있게 한다.
- 이번 차수에서 하지 않은 일: 새 전략 개발, 전략 성과 개선, 대규모 Monte Carlo / batch runner, full artifact / trade log / holdings / macro / raw provider JSONL 저장, live approval, broker order, account sync, auto rebalance, registry / saved JSONL 재작성, 기존 Robustness Lab 삭제.

## Product Tracks

| Track | Current State | Main Surfaces | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data Collection / Data Trust | DB-backed ingestion baseline complete | `Workspace > Ingestion`, MySQL, loaders | UI에서 provider / FRED / external source를 직접 fetch하지 않는다. Overview bounded refresh는 `app/jobs/overview_actions.py` facade만 통과한다 |
| Overview / Market Context | Production baseline plus recent sentiment / Why It Moved work complete | `Workspace > Overview` | Market context and investigation only; bounded refresh action allowed through facade; no trade signal, approval, order, registry rewrite |
| Backtest Analysis | Candidate creation plus Risk-On Momentum 5D research lane and Strategy Promotion Contract handoff baseline complete | `Backtest > Backtest Analysis`, `reports/backtests/` | 후보 source 생성 단계; `backtest-dev` result promotion은 contract를 먼저 채우며, final decision / monitoring governance는 기존 gate와 후속 승인 scope가 소유 |
| Practical Validation / Final Review | Investability evidence workflow complete through P2 / P3 and first hardening cycle | `Backtest > Practical Validation`, `Backtest > Final Review` | PASS / BLOCKER / selected-route gate는 validation evidence가 소유; sentiment overlay is context-only |
| Operations / Portfolio Monitoring | Operations Console, daily-monitoring-first Portfolio Monitoring, and explicit Monitoring Snapshot / Review loop complete | `Operations > Operations Console`, `Operations > Portfolio Monitoring`, `System / Data Health`, archive lanes | Read-only monitoring, explicit scenario update, explicit append-only snapshot/review save; no live approval, broker order, account sync, auto rebalance |
| UI / Engine Boundary | Service/runtime boundary and lint baseline complete | `app/services`, `app/runtime`, `app/web` | UI handles render/session state; runtime / service owns engine dispatch, JSONL helpers, read models |

## Recently Merged Work

| Workstream | Status | Durable Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Overview Market Sentiment V1 | 1차~3차 complete | CNN Fear & Greed / AAII collect into `finance_meta.macro_series_observation`. Overview Sentiment, Practical Validation, Final Review, and Portfolio Monitoring read it as context-only market backdrop. |
| Operations Overview IA / Operations Console V2-V5 | Complete | Operations now has a console entry, Portfolio Monitoring and System / Data Health primary lanes, archive / recovery labels for Backtest Runs and Candidate Library, and disabled live trading boundary copy. |
| Risk-On Momentum 5D V1/V2 | Implementation / QA complete | Daily Swing research lane added under Backtest Analysis. V2 adds ATR exit, macro ranking penalty, comparison / sensitivity / stability / trade-cause / quality-warning analysis, S&P 500 universe option. Governance connection to Practical Validation / Final Review / Portfolio Monitoring is deferred. |
| Selected Dashboard Monitoring First UX V1 | Complete | Portfolio Monitoring opens with Active Portfolio Monitoring Scenario first, while portfolio setup and strategy board sit below. Scenario results stay explicit/session-based and do not auto-write monitoring logs. |
| Monitoring Snapshot / Review Loop V2 | Complete | Portfolio Monitoring can compare latest / previous saved snapshot with the current scenario and append compact monitoring evidence only when the user presses `Save Monitoring Snapshot` or `Record Review`. |
| Strategy Promotion Contract Handoff | Complete | Backtest report workspace now has a Strategy Promotion Contract guide, reusable template, and structural checker so `backtest-dev` strategy results must disclose universe, PIT / survivorship, optimization, OOS / walk-forward, cost / liquidity, replay, generated artifact, blockers, and monitoring triggers before product workflow promotion review. |
| Robustness Experiment Registry | Complete | Practical Validation now attaches a compact `robustness_run_set_id` summary over existing Robustness Lab / temporal / realism evidence, and Final Review investability packets / saved decision evidence can cite the same run-set without replacing the Robustness Lab board or storing full artifacts. |
| Overview Market Movers Second Pass / Why It Moved | Current V1 complete; V2 decision pending | Return / Volume rank, previous-period context, manual investigation board, keyless Google News KR RSS metadata/snippet, compact SEC metadata table. No article body, filing body, AI summary, catalyst classifier, DB schema, registry, saved setup write. |
| Futures Market Monitoring / Macro Thermometer | Complete | yfinance futures 1m / daily OHLCV feeds Futures Monitor and Macro Thermometer. Historical validation is point-in-time read-only context, not a prediction guarantee. |

## Completed Foundations

| Foundation | Status | Closeout |
|---|---|---|
| UI Engine Boundary Foundation / Cleanup | Complete | Service/runtime boundary and `app.services/app.runtime -> app.web` import hard-fail lint baseline are in place. |
| Investability Decision Foundation | Complete | Validation gate, storage governance, data provenance, look-through, robustness, selected monitoring, decision dossier baseline complete. |
| Phase 8 Data Evidence Expansion | Complete | Provider / macro / provenance / lifecycle evidence added for investability workflow. |
| Phase 9 Cost / Slippage / Liquidity Realism | Complete | Cost model, turnover, net-cost curve, liquidity / capacity, cost / slippage sensitivity evidence added. |
| Phase 10 Walk-forward / OOS / Regime Validation | Complete | Temporal validation, holdout, macro regime evidence added and connected to selection evidence. |
| Phase 11 Portfolio Construction Risk Controls | Complete | Concentration / overlap / exposure, risk contribution, component role / weight evidence added. |
| Phase 12 Selected Monitoring / Recheck Operations | Complete | Recheck readiness, provider evidence staleness, review signals, allocation boundary, decision dossier continuity complete. |
| Phase 13 First-Cycle Hardening Closeout | Complete | Integrated QA, gate matrix, storage audit, docs/runbook alignment, residual risk carry-forward complete. |
| Practical Validation V2 P2 / P3 | Closeout complete | Provider / macro / look-through / robustness normalization and selected monitoring handoff QA complete. |
| Documentation / AI Workspace Rebuild | Practical closeout | `.aiworkspace/note/finance` and repo-local skill/plugin source are canonical. |

## Next Decisions

| Candidate | Why It Matters | Requires Approval Before |
|---|---|---|
| Backtest Compare follow-up splits | 9차 first pass moved the visual shell, but saved replay, weighted result, and strategy-specific form body still remain in `app/web/backtest_compare.py` | Moving saved replay / weighted result / strategy form sections into focused modules while preserving service/runtime boundaries |
| Large-surface second refactor round | 10차 closeout confirmed large files remain in Backtest Compare, Overview, Operations / Portfolio Monitoring runtime, and Overview services | Opening a new focused refactor round that changes module ownership or public call paths |
| Physical task / phase archive migration | `tasks/active` and `phases/active` still contain retained completed folders even though current active state is now manifest-clean | Moving folders, deleting retained boards, changing archive layout, or repairing historical links |
| Overview Why It Moved V2 | Current V1 is manual/session-only; durable metadata retention or SEC financial-statement preview needs a storage/source policy | DB schema, article/filing body handling, AI summary, catalyst classification |
| Risk-On Momentum 5D governance | Strategy is implemented as research lane and now has a promotion contract checklist, but it is still not connected to validation / monitoring daily signal policy | Practical Validation module, Final Review gate, Portfolio Monitoring signal integration after a filled promotion contract is reviewed |
| Overview scheduler hardening | Browser-session refresh exists; OS scheduler / launchd production operation is a separate decision | Enabling unattended scheduled collection |
| UI platform split | Streamlit is workable but complex UX may eventually benefit from API + React/Next.js | Any large frontend migration or service API expansion |
| Second-cycle investability hardening | Phase 13 carry-forward material can seed another phase | Opening a new phase from carry-forward matrix |

## Work Model

| Layer | Location | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Phase | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/phases/active/<phase>/` | User-approved multi-task direction, design, integration owner |
| Task | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/tasks/active/<task>/` | Actual implementation, docs, QA, investigation unit |
| Research | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/researches/active/<research-id>/` | Product direction / benchmark / feature opportunity body |
| Durable Docs | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/docs/` | Stable project knowledge after implementation or approved direction |
| Root Handoff Logs | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/WORK_PROGRESS.md`, `.aiworkspace/note/finance/QUESTION_AND_ANALYSIS_LOG.md` | 3~5 line milestone / decision pointers only |

## Update Rules

- Add detailed implementation history to task docs, not this roadmap.
- Keep this roadmap focused on active state, completed foundations, and next decisions.
- Update `PRODUCT_DIRECTION.md` when the product purpose or user-facing workflow changes.
- Update `PROJECT_MAP.md` when ownership boundaries or entry points change.
- Update architecture / flow / data docs when runtime, storage, or user workflow boundaries change.
- Use `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES.md` as the first checkpoint for layer / storage / product surface boundary changes.
