# Finance Project Map

Status: Active
Last Verified: 2026-07-01

## Project Summary

`finance`는 MySQL-backed data ingestion, market context dashboard, strategy backtest runtime, Practical Validation / Final Review evidence workflow, Operations Portfolio Monitoring을 함께 가진 quant research workspace다.

현재 merged product map은 네 경계를 특히 중요하게 본다.

- Data / macro / sentiment / futures는 `finance/data/* -> MySQL -> finance/loaders/*` 흐름을 유지한다.
- Financial statements now use EDGAR detailed statement ingestion and statement shadow tables as the canonical source path. Broad yfinance fundamentals / factors remain legacy compatibility for old replay or explicit comparison only.
- Backtest strategy engine과 daily swing research lane은 `finance/*`, `app/runtime/*`, `app/services/*`가 소유하고, Streamlit UI는 payload / render / session state에 집중한다.
- Practical Validation / Final Review / Portfolio Monitoring은 compact evidence와 read-only service model을 공유하되, approval / broker / auto rebalance 경계는 넘지 않는다.
- Overview의 Sentiment, Futures Macro, Why It Moved는 context / investigation surface이며 validation gate나 monitoring signal을 만들지 않는다.

| Overview dashboard render | `app/web/overview_dashboard.py` is now a 1-export compatibility wrapper for `render_overview_dashboard`; active page shell lives in `app/web/overview/page.py`, primary tab entry orchestration lives under `app/web/overview/market_context.py`, `market_movers.py`, `futures_macro.py`, `sentiment.py`, and `events.py`, and tab-local Streamlit glue lives in the matching `*_helpers.py` modules. Primary navigation constants / selector body live in `app/web/overview/navigation.py`. `app/web/overview/legacy_dashboard.py` was deleted in `overview-legacy-dashboard-removal-v17-v24-20260625`; active tab modules and helper modules no longer import or delegate to a legacy dashboard file. Domain visual renderer bodies now live in `app/web/overview/components/`: `common.py` owns visual tokens / shared CSS / shared strips, `layout.py` owns the market-session banner, `market_context.py` owns Market Context cockpit / analog / source confidence / IA closeout renderers, `market_movers.py` owns Market Movers breadth / refresh components, `events.py` owns Events / macro-week renderers, and `data_health.py` owns the Data Health handoff component. `app/web/overview_ui_components.py` remains only a small compatibility facade for older component imports. `Workspace > Overview` top-level deep navigation uses a selected-tab lazy renderer, not native eager `st.tabs`. The primary selector uses Streamlit internal `st.pills` state, styled as Korean-first text tabs with an active red underline rather than anchor navigation. Query-param slugs such as `?overview_tab=market-movers` and `?overview_tab=futures-macro` remain compatibility input, but the page does not render tab `<a href>` links. `Market Context` is the default selected surface and renders immediately when selected; no explicit `시장 맥락 불러오기` gate is used. Primary Overview tabs are Market Context, Market Movers, Futures Macro, Sentiment, and Events. `Futures Monitor` and `Sector / Industry` standalone tab wrappers are removed from Overview; `Futures Macro` owns stored daily futures macro diagnosis / historical validation, while sector evidence remains available inside Market Context read models and supporting service/helper functions. Data Health is handled through Market Context source / refresh evidence plus Operations / Ingestion ownership; Candidate Ops is not rendered in Overview and its old overview snapshot helpers are removed |
| Overview market intelligence service | `app/services/overview/*` owns the Streamlit-free Overview read-model implementation by domain: `market_context.py` for cockpit / source confidence, `market_movers.py` for movers / group leadership / breadth / date windows, `events.py` for event calendar / macro week lane, `sentiment.py` for CNN / AAII sentiment, `data_health.py` for collection ops / ingestion handoff, `why_it_moved.py` for catalyst / compact metadata helpers, and `ia.py` for static IA closeout guidance. The old `app/services/overview_market_intelligence.py` compatibility facade has been removed; internal app and tests import the owning domain service directly |
| Overview Market Movers workbench | `app/web/overview/market_movers_helpers.py`, `app/web/overview/components/market_movers.py`, and `app/services/overview/market_movers.py` own the Market Movers workbench flow: command strip, exploration modes, selected-symbol investigation handoff, sector breadth/heatmap context, and coverage trust summary. Coverage trust groups missing diagnostics first and leaves raw symbol diagnostics collapsed; it remains context-only and uses existing Overview action facade paths for refresh actions such as Nasdaq Symbol Directory and selected-symbol EDGAR statement refresh from the SEC filing tab. |
| Overview historical analog service | `app/services/overview_market_context_analog.py`; sector leadership -> sector ETF proxy -> SPY-relative historical distribution read model. Supports selected as-of bounded replay and 5D / 20D / monthly pattern windows using existing DB prices plus current universe / sector metadata. Latest mode can receive a visible daily sector leadership snapshot from `app/web/overview_dashboard_helpers.py`, so the analog anchor sector can match the sector pressure map; selected as-of still loads a selected-date daily sector snapshot. `pattern_window` changes the similarity window, not the sector leadership source. The read model exposes requested vs effective as-of alignment, limiting symbols, basis warnings, and a bounded `overview_historical_analog_ohlcv` repair action when common daily price coverage is older than the selected date. As of `overview-futures-macro-tab-split-v1-20260624`, the default `Market Context` entry does not render historical analog controls or load this read model; it is retained as an opt-in read model / helper until a later approved surface decision. `app/web/overview/components/market_context.py` renders the broad result as compact basis summary, collapsed calculation-boundary detail, method line, summary strip, and a core 5D / 20D / 60D matrix across sector ETF / SPY / QQQ / TLT / GLD, with raw detail tables collapsed. Macro comparison remains a separate compact section and is hidden when broad analog rows are unavailable. The Macro section separates `Sector ETF vs SPY relative strength` as the broad basis from additional GLD / Rate Pressure futures conditions. FRED rates / events / sentiment hard conditioning remain disabled or excluded |
| Overview Macro Context Cockpit read model | `app/services/overview/market_context.py` owns `build_overview_macro_context_cockpit` and composes the split domain services for movement, breadth, sentiment, events, and data state; rendered by `app/web/overview/components/market_context.py` and loaded through `app/web/overview_dashboard_helpers.py`. The default Market Context helper calls the cockpit with `include_futures_macro=False`, `include_historical_analog=False`, and direct Market Context refresh scope, so first entry reads movement, breadth, sentiment, events, and data state without running futures macro historical validation, historical analog, Top1000 / Top2000, or Futures refresh actions. Full futures macro diagnosis remains available when explicitly requested and is user-facing through `Futures Macro`. `brief_rows` is the user-facing Market Context brief sequence for movement, breadth, and event background in light mode; the full mode can include Futures/Macro backdrop. During open trading the brief can be `오늘의 시장 브리프`; during weekends / holidays it becomes `마지막 거래일 시장 브리프` and uses the previous trading date as basis. The sector pressure map normalizes provider sector aliases into the canonical 11 display sectors and should render all 11 as equal tiles; value and color, not tile size or omission, communicate pressure. Events remain in event timeline / source evidence / compatibility findings unless a future approved cause-analysis dimension changes that boundary. `refresh_plan` maps only direct Market Context resolvable or partially resolvable data issues to bounded Overview action ids; Top1000 / Top2000 and Futures refresh remain owned by Market Movers / Futures Macro or Ingestion surfaces. Non-actionable caveats and closed-session intraday elapsed-age stale states stay excluded; full Market Context refresh remains a secondary fallback limited to S&P 500 movers, sentiment, and event calendars. Top `자료 상태` should count actionable refresh items, not Events reference caveats or Data Health management meta. `context_findings` / `next_checks` remain compatibility payloads and should not be rendered as a default user-facing action checklist |
| Overview Events / Macro Week read model | `app/services/overview/events.py` owns `build_market_events_snapshot` and `build_overview_macro_week_lane`; active tab entry is `app/web/overview/events.py`, with tab-local UI glue in `app/web/overview/events_helpers.py` and visual components in `app/web/overview/components/events.py`. Event context reads recent 7D plus upcoming rows and prioritizes FOMC / CPI / PPI / Employment / GDP over earnings for scan surfaces |
| Overview Data Health Ingestion Handoff read model | `app/services/overview/data_health.py` owns `build_collection_ops_snapshot` and `build_overview_data_health_ingestion_handoff`; retained as a read-only helper / historical task artifact. Collection ops rows now expose `Scope` / coverage counts that separate direct Market Context sources from reference or dedicated-tab sources such as Top1000 / Top2000 and Futures. Current user-facing Overview no longer has a `Data Health` tab; practical data-health navigation is Market Context source / refresh evidence plus `Operations > System / Data Health` / `Workspace > Ingestion` |
| Overview Source Confidence Catalog read model | `app/services/overview/market_context.py` owns `build_overview_source_confidence_catalog`; embedded in the macro cockpit model and rendered by `app/web/overview/components/market_context.py`. It exposes `source_role`, `actionability`, and `counts_for_status` so direct brief sources, reference limitations, and management meta are separated. Futures source confidence is included only when the cockpit explicitly includes futures macro. Events estimate caveats are `참고 제한`; Data Health is `관리 메타`; only actionable source rows count as unresolved `자료 확인 필요` |
| Overview IA Closeout guide | `app/services/overview/ia.py` via `load_overview_ia_closeout_model`, imported through `app/web/overview_dashboard_helpers.py` for compatibility; now documents market-context tabs plus external Data Repair ownership. Candidate Ops is no longer part of the Overview guide |
| Overview futures monitor service | `app/services/futures_market_monitoring.py` |
| Overview futures macro thermometer service | `app/services/futures_macro_thermometer.py`; builds stored-1D futures macro score / scenario / confidence, keeps `weekly_context` from recent 5D futures moves for compatibility, and exposes `flow_context` for `1D` / `1W` / `1M` reading flow plus Korean `evidence_reading` groups for the `Futures Macro` tab. Snapshot cache keys include the latest stored 1D futures candle marker so a newly collected daily candle invalidates stale in-process cache. The top-level `혼재된 매크로 흐름` scenario stays stable for validation compatibility, while the read model can add `sub_scenario`, `regime_hint`, and `mixed_reason` to explain mixed states such as growth weakness without safe-haven confirmation, rate-easing growth weakness, dollar-pressure risk-off candidates, commodity weakness / demand slowdown candidates, transition zones, or low-signal watch states. `app/services/futures_macro_validation.py` keeps historical validation read-only and uses latest futures / proxy markers for process-level cache reuse; it does not create a DB materialized validation table. `app/web/overview/futures_macro_react_component.py` wraps the `app/web/streamlit_components/futures_macro_workbench/` React/Vite build for the tab workbench; Python still owns DB reads, validation calculation, refresh actions, and raw tables. React renders `현재 근거` plus `오늘과 비슷했던 과거 상태 확인`, where historical validation is explained as checking the current 16-futures daily state against historical states computed by the same method. The lower Streamlit disclosure owns `계산 근거 / 원본 표` only: raw score, score contribution, daily futures move, and historical sample tables. Historical validation remains read-only context, not a prediction guarantee, trading signal, validation gate, or monitoring signal |

## Backtest Workflow Boundary

```text
Backtest Analysis
  -> Practical Validation
  -> Final Review
  -> Operations > Portfolio Monitoring
```

역할:

- Backtest Analysis는 후보 source를 만든다.
- Practical Validation은 source를 실전 투입 전 조건으로 검증하고 source traits 기반 module planner로 필수 / 조건부 / 후속 참고 검증과 Final Review 이동 gate를 만든다. Step 1은 source의 단일 / mix 구성, component 전략, target weight, 원래 result table, monthly selection / holdings history를 먼저 확인하게 한다. 화면의 `Final Review Gate`, audit board, provider board, Robustness Lab은 board registry를 통해 어떤 module의 evidence인지 표시하며, 후보 특성상 적용되지 않는 조건부 board는 비적용으로 분리한다. `검증 결과 저장(기록용)`은 audit trail만 남기고, Gate 미통과 result는 Final Review 후보가 아니다.
- Final Review는 Practical Validation Gate를 통과한 result만 source picker에 표시한다. Provider / Look-through / Robustness Lab / Construction Risk / Risk Contribution / Component Role Weight / Validation Efficacy / Data Coverage / Backtest Realism 근거와 investability packet을 읽어 profile-aware gate policy로 selected-route 가능 여부를 판정한다. Validation Efficacy의 walk-forward / OOS / regime non-PASS row와 Construction Risk / Risk Contribution / Component Role / Weight non-PASS row도 selected-route blocker 또는 review-required 근거로 표시하고, selected-route gate까지 통과한 후보만 `SELECT_FOR_PRACTICAL_PORTFOLIO`로 정식 저장한다. 보류 / 거절 / 재검토는 새 저장 row가 아니라 상태 안내이며, 저장된 선정 기록은 read-only dossier와 Selected Dashboard handoff summary로 다시 보여준다.
- Operations Console은 Operations의 입구로, Portfolio Monitoring Status summary와 Evidence Health mini strip을 먼저 보여준 뒤 priority / evidence / metric 기반 review queue와 Portfolio Monitoring / System Data Health primary lane을 둔다. Summary는 active portfolio, assigned strategy, stale / pending scenario metadata, blocked / missing / incomplete slot, open review, target snapshot, next review를 읽기 전용으로 요약한다. Evidence Health는 scenario freshness, selected evidence readiness, open review, system run health를 이미 로드된 selected dashboard / monitoring portfolio setup / run history payload에서만 요약하며 provider DB 세부 조회나 새 수집을 실행하지 않는다. Review queue는 setup blocker, system run failure, scenario freshness, open review, routine monitoring, no-selected-row guidance를 sort rank로 정렬하지만 job 실행 / registry write / scenario replay는 만들지 않는다. Archive / development-history decision table은 운영 화면에 노출하지 않으며, Backtest Run History / Candidate Library 데이터와 helper code 삭제는 별도 audit 전까지 하지 않는다. 기존 Selected Portfolio Dashboard route는 `Portfolio Monitoring` navigation label 아래 유지된다. Portfolio Monitoring 화면은 Active Portfolio Monitoring Scenario를 상단 hero로 먼저 보여주며, active portfolio가 없으면 생성 안내를, portfolio가 있지만 전략이 없으면 strategy board 안내를, 전략은 있지만 scenario가 없으면 아래 `포트폴리오 시나리오 업데이트` 실행 안내를 보여준다. Scenario 결과가 있으면 portfolio-wide 현재 가치 / 손익 / 수익률 / CAGR / MDD / 기준일 / session update timestamp / value curve / 전략별 성과 / target snapshot을 상단에서 확인한다. Portfolio card shelf는 hero 아래 active selector로 두고, portfolio 이름 / 설명 edit, Final Review selected strategy slot board, start / latest-end mode / balance / memo 저장, pending-stale scenario update action은 그 아래 관리 영역에 둔다. Scenario 결과는 portfolio / slot / selected decision / start / end / balance signature가 맞을 때만 합산한다. 리밸런싱 표는 `Target Snapshot Date`, `Next Review Date`, `Current Target Snapshot`으로 표시되며 주문 지시나 자동 리밸런싱이 아니다. 개별 strategy Monitoring Scenario와 read-only recheck readiness / symbol freshness / provider evidence / continuity / timeline / review signal / open issue / optional deployment preflight / allocation boundary는 사용자가 선택한 1개 전략 상세를 열 때만 렌더링한다. Deployment Readiness preflight도 승인 / 주문 / broker-account 연동 / 자동 리밸런싱을 만들지 않는다.

## Data Boundary

| Data | Location | Commit Policy |
|---|---|---|
| Current / candidate / final decision registries | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/registries/*.jsonl` | 명시 요청 없이는 새 runtime 생성물 커밋 금지. 저장 경계는 `docs/data/STORAGE_GOVERNANCE.md` 기준 |
| Saved portfolio setup | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/saved/*.jsonl` | 보존 대상. validation / approval record가 아니라 reusable setup. `SELECTED_DASHBOARD_PORTFOLIOS.jsonl`은 Operations > Portfolio Monitoring의 사용자 monitoring portfolio setup이며 legacy dashboard file name을 유지한다 |
| Backtest result reports | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/reports/backtests/` | 사람이 읽는 결과/근거 문서. JSONL source-of-truth 대체 금지 |
| Backtest run history | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/run_history/*.jsonl` | local runtime artifact, 보통 커밋 금지 |
| Backtest generated artifacts | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/backtest_artifacts/` | full scanner / trade detail 같은 generated artifact, 보통 커밋 금지 |
| Run artifacts | `.aiworkspace/note/finance/run_artifacts/` | local runtime artifact, 보통 커밋 금지 |
| Playwright output | `.playwright-mcp/` | generated artifact, 커밋 금지 |

Code resolves these paths through `app/workspace_paths.py`; app/runtime and app/jobs should not recreate legacy `.note/finance` paths directly.
