## Next Target

`allocation-drift-evidence-boundary-v1`

Goal:

- Actual Allocation의 current value / shares x price / current weight 입력이 read-only drift evidence로만 쓰이게 한다.
- drift alert preview가 order draft, broker action, auto rebalance로 오해되지 않게 boundary와 label을 정리한다.
- session-state drift evidence와 durable monitoring log를 명확히 분리한다.

Out of scope:

- 새 JSONL registry
- monitoring log 자동 저장
- user memo / preset persistence
- broker order / live approval / auto rebalance
- account holdings 자동 연결
- UI direct provider / FRED / broker fetch
- full holdings / price history / macro series workflow JSONL 저장
