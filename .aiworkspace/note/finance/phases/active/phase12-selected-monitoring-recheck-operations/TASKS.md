## Next Target

`selected-monitoring-source-map-v1`

Goal:

- Selected Portfolio Dashboard의 현재 evidence source ownership을 먼저 확인한다.
- Final Review decision row, selected dashboard runtime model, provider / price DB loaders, session-state recheck result, optional allocation input의 경계를 나눈다.
- Phase 12에서 새 persistence가 필요한지 판단하기 전에 기존 read-only source로 해결 가능한 gap을 분리한다.

Out of scope:

- 새 JSONL registry
- monitoring log 자동 저장
- user memo / preset persistence
- broker order / live approval / auto rebalance
- account holdings 자동 연결
- UI direct provider / FRED / broker fetch
- full holdings / price history / macro series workflow JSONL 저장
