## Next Target

Phase 13 first-cycle hardening closeout

Goal:

- Phase 8 through Phase 12 hardening results를 한 번 더 묶어 gate / docs / runbook / carry-forward 기준을 정리한다.
- Phase 12에서 남긴 residual risk와 Phase 13 handoff를 확인한다.
- 새 구현은 Phase 13 board를 열 때 별도 task로 분리한다.

Out of scope:

- 새 JSONL registry
- monitoring log 자동 저장
- user memo / preset persistence
- broker order / live approval / auto rebalance
- account holdings 자동 연결
- UI direct provider / FRED / broker fetch
- full holdings / price history / macro series workflow JSONL 저장
